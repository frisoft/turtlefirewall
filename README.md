## Turtle Firewall

Turtle Firewall allows you to configure a Linux firewall in a simple and fast way.
It's based on Linux iptables. Its way of working is easy to understand: you can define the different firewall elements (zones, hosts, networks) and then set the services you want to enable among the different elements or groups of elements.
You can do this simply editing a XML file or using the handy web interface [Webmin](http://www.webmin.com/).

Turtle Firewall is an Open Source project written using the perl language and realeased under GPL version 2.0 by Andrea Frigido (Frisoft).
